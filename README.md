# School-Projects
This project for Chada Tech focused on developing an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer. The main goal was to analyze grocery item data from text records to identify the frequency of each item purchased. By automating this process, the program solves the problem of manually tracking inventory trends, giving the store valuable insights into popular products and restocking needs.

One area where I felt I did particularly well was breaking down the problem into manageable parts and structuring the program around functions that handle specific tasks, like reading data from files, parsing that data, and updating item counts. This modular approach kept the project organized and made each part of the code easier to troubleshoot and understand.

Looking back, there are a few ways I could enhance the code. For example, I could improve efficiency by using a hash map to track item counts, which would make searching and updating faster. I could also add more error handling around file access and data validation to make the program more robust and secure. Refactoring some repetitive code into separate functions would help streamline the program and make future updates easier to implement.

One of the most challenging parts was efficiently parsing and updating item counts as the data scaled up. To overcome this, I researched optimal data structures in C++, like hash maps, and used references for syntax tips and best practices. Adding version control and debugging tools to my workflow also helped me stay on top of the codeâ€™s development and make quick adjustments as needed.

From this project, I gained a few transferable skills that I think will be useful in future work. Skills like analyzing and transforming data, working with file I/O operations, and choosing efficient data structures will all be valuable in any data-heavy project.

To keep the code maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I used clear variable and function names and kept the functions focused on single tasks. Adding comments helped with readability, and organizing the program so that data handling and business logic are somewhat separate makes it easier to make changes in the future if needed.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience, and I feel it set me up with skills and insights that I can carry into future assignments and roles.
